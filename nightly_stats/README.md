## DJANGO DATABASE ##
This program is meant to provide practice in setting up and creating a new
django database.  We're taking data from a project from the prior weekend, and
plugging it into a new interface, django. By running through some of these
databases through django lets us start figuring out how to put these data
science programs into the public view, and allows us to start figuring how
the public will be able to use the data we're giving them.

From here, as we continue to learn the capabilities of django, I'll be looking
to update this program with an html user interface as well as ways to print and
save the information they'll input to the database.
